h2. iPhone AddressBook Objective-C Wrapper APIs

The classes in this project implement a (currently lightweight) wrapper around the iPhone's pure-C AddressBook framework. Currently it simply plays nicely with things like autorelease pools and implements other Objective-C paradigms such as property-based accessors. In the future I hope to make it look and behave in a manner similar to the ObjC AddressBook APIs in Mac OS X.
